# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline for Spring Boot Application

This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment of a Spring Boot application to Docker Hub.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates the following tasks:

- Building the Spring Boot application using Maven.
- Running unit tests and generating test reports.
- Building a Docker image of the application.
- Pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub.
- Deploying the application to a target environment (e.g., a container orchestration platform).

## CI/CD Workflow

The CI/CD workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` file. It consists of the following stages:

1. **Build and Test**:
   - Checkout the source code.
   - Build the Spring Boot application using Maven.
   - Run unit tests.
   - Generate test reports.

2. **Docker Build and Publish**:
   - Build a Docker image of the application.
   - Push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
   
3. **Deployment (Optional)**:
   - Deploy the Docker container to a target environment (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

To use this CI/CD pipeline, you need:

- A GitHub repository for your Spring Boot application.
- A Docker Hub account and repository to publish Docker images.
- The target environment where you want to deploy the application (e.g., Kubernetes cluster, AWS ECS).

### Configuration

1. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Make sure your Spring Boot application's source code is hosted on GitHub.

2. **GitHub Secrets**:
   - Set the following GitHub Secrets in your repository settings:
     - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
     - `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or access token.

3. **Pipeline Customization**:
   - Customize the pipeline workflow in `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` to match your project's structure and requirements.

### Triggering the Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically when you push changes to your GitHub repository. You can also manually trigger it from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Directory Structure

- `.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions workflow configuration.
- `src`: Contains the source code of your Spring Boot application.
- `Dockerfile`: Specifies how to build the Docker image of the application.
